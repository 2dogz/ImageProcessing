# Image Processing

## How to run

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python image_size.py --image images/example_01.png --width 0.955
```


## Virtual Environments

I recommend running this within a Virtual Environment, documentation can be found [here](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/) if you are not familiar with Virtual Environments.
